# Smarter Contracts: Detecting Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts with Deep Transfer Learning

## Abstract

In this work, we develop ESCORT, a **deep learning-based vulnerability detection method** that uses a common feature extractor to **learn generic bytecode semantics** of smart contracts and **separate branches to learn the features of each vulnerability type**.
